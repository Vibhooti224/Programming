Input : A[] = {5, 7, 9, 3, 6, 2}, 
        B[] = {1, 2, 6, -1, 0, 9}
Output : -9
Explanation:
The first array is 5 7 9 3 6 2. 
The max element among these elements is 9.
The second array is 1 2 6 -1 0 9.
The min element among these elements is -1.
The product of 9 and -1 is 9*-1=-9.


CODE:
def find_multiplication (self, arr, brr, n, m) : 
	max=arr[0]
	min=brr[0]
	for i in range(n):
		if (arr[i]>max):
			max=arr[i]
	for i in range(m):
		if (brr[i]<min):
			min=brr[i]
	return(max*min)
